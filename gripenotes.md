- Successfully created vanilla unpacked chrome extension. Going to go with this as far as I can before I add in build tools.
- Turns out Node v22 breaks gulp... downgrading to Node 20.12.2
- Livereload now works
- Added Rollup and Typescript
- Added Tailwind and Daisy and set theme to Cupcake

I still need to add React by adding it as a plugin to rollup, but I'm going to take a break for now. For some reason, React is not being bundled into the `dist/sidebar.js` file.

I'm happy with the progress I've made today & I'm going to call it a day. I'll pick this up tomorrow.
